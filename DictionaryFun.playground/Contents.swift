/*: question1
 ### 1. Given the following states, New York, Ohio, Florida, Georgia and Kentucky, create a dictionary which stores these states along with their capitals. The capitals of these states are as follows (in the correct order), Albany, Columbus, Tallahassee, Atlanta, and Frankfort.
 */
// write your code here

var stateAndCapitals = ["New York": "Albany",
                        "Ohio": "Columbus",
                        "Florida": "Tallahassee",

                        "Kentucky": "Frankfort"
]



/*: question2
 ### 2. What is the type of the dictionary you created in Question 1?
 */
// Dictionary is of type [String: String]



/*: question3
 ### 3. Create a variable called `capital` and assign to it Florida's capital from the dictionary.
 */
// write your code here


var capital = stateAndCapitals["Florida"]
/*: question4
 ### 4. Unwrap `capital` and print out the message "The capital of Florida is <Capital>" to the console.
 */
// write your code here

if var capital = capital {
    print("The capital of Florida is \(capital)")
}

/*: question5
 ### 5. Create a variable called `anotherCapital` and assign to it the value of Pennsylvania's capital from the dictionary.
 */
// write your code here

var anotherCapital = stateAndCapitals["Pennsylvanie"]


/*: question6
 ### 6. Unwrap `anotherCapital` and print out the message "I don't know Pennsylvania's capital" to the console.
 */
// write your code here

if var anotherCapital = anotherCapital {
    print("\(anotherCapital)")
} else {
    print("I don't know Pennsylvania's capital")
}

/*: question7
 ### 7. Pennsylvania's capital is Harrisburg. Add it to your state capitals dictionary.
 */
// write your code here

stateAndCapitals["Pennsylvania"] = "Harrisburg"
/*: question8
 ### 8. Retrieve Pennsylvania's capital from your dictionary. Unwrap it and print the message "Pennsylvania's capital is <Capital>" to the console.
 */
// write your code here

if var pennsCap = stateAndCapitals["Pennsylvania"] {
    print("Pennsylvania's capital is \(pennsCap)")
}

/*: question9
 ### 9. We don't really care about Pennsylvania's capital. Delete it from the dictionary. Print your dictionary to the console to ensure it's gone.
 */
// write your code here

stateAndCapitals["Pennsylvania"] = nil

/*: question10
 ### 10. You have been given the constant `state` with a state name. Use that constant to retrieve the state's capital from the dictionary. Print "The capital of <State> is <Capital>" to the console.
 */
let state = "New York"
// write your code here

print("The capital of \(state) is \(stateAndCapitals["New York"]!)")


/*: question11
 ### 11. Dictionaries don't have to contain just `String` keys and values. Create a dictionary that contains the name of a band, and the members of that band. Here are the bands and members that you can use:

 * Nirvana: Kurt Cobain, Krist Novoselic, Dave Grohl
 * The Beatles: John Lennon, George Harrison, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr
 * The Breeders: Kim Deal, Kelley Deal, Josephine Wiggs, Jim Macpherson
 * Pixies: Frank Black, Joey Santiago, Kim Deal, David Lovering

 Since there are multiple members for each band, the value of each key should be an `Array`.

             "The Beatles": ["John Lennon", "George Harrison", "Paul McCartney", "Ringo Starr"],

             "Pixies": ["Frank Black", "Joey Santiago", "Kim Deal", "David Lovering"]
]


/*: question12
 ### 12. What is the type of the dictionary you created in Question 11?
 */
// The dicitionary is of type String: [String]


/*: question13
 ### 13. You have been given a band name in the constant `band` below. Use that band name to retrieve its list of members from the array you created in Question 11. Then unwrap that list of members and print it to the console.
 */
let bandName = "Pixies"
